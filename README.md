Steps Taken:
Data Collection: Acquired the unicorn companies dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to understand the structure of the dataset, identify inconsistent values, and explore key features.

Data Cleaning: Addressed inconsistent data such as the billion and million by imputing values, dropping columns with NAN, and changing data types

Calculations and Transformations: Calculated new metrics, such as Return on Investment (ROI) and time to become a unicorn, to derive valuable insights.

Visualization: Used various visualization tools, including Matplotlib and Plotly Express, to create charts and graphs for better data interpretation.

Explored the distribution of unicorn companies across industries and geographical locations. Identified industry hubs and top cities.

Recommendations: Provided data-driven recommendations based on the analysis to assist unicorn companies in making strategic decisions.


Challenges Faced:
Dealing with inconsistent data in the funding and valuation columns required careful consideration to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.

inputing the right codes to effectively generate the right outputs to understand thedataset .

Gaining a comprehensive understanding of both business and data aspects was essential for deriving meaningful recommendations.
